# Generic forward list in C language
This is a generic implementation of the singly linked list data structure developed in C language to give user the capability to store any type of data and manipulate it through a set of methods
with linear time access to elements, and fixed time insertion/deletion at any point in the sequence. The methods provided are fast and lightweight for a computer, Also this implementation
is a powerful C alternative to the built-in template class std::forward_list in C++.

<h2> Why do we need a generic implementation of a data structure in C language? </h2>
A generic and reliable implementation of a data structure must satisfy the needs of user, saves time and effort and reduce complexity and confusion. Instead of implementing different versions of the same data 
structure in order to store and manipulate data of different types.
